This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python and Tkinter for the graphical user interface.
How to Play:
Run the script to start the game.
Click on the grid to place your 'X' or 'O'.
The game will automatically switch turns between players.
The first player to get three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.
If all spaces are filled without a winner, it's a tie.
